Beetroot Music Manager
===================================

> This is the project's namesake. This project is abandoned, but remains here as the starting point of this whole adventure.

> For the Beetroot of today, [see here](https://beetroot.live).

A music sorter and web interface that roots through your beats so you don't have to.
**Please keep in mind the project is still in development. It may be unstable.**

## What does it do
Beetroot is a music library manager which contains a sorter (based on the ID tags). And that's about it! You can only import things...

Here's its output with my music library (as of 6/6/2016)

## Coming in the future
* Web Player (already working on it)
* Customisable paths (you need to edit the source code to set your path so far)
